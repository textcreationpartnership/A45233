            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Here's Goſpel Truths, very brief and plain,</l>

<note place="margin">Mat. 18.3.</note>
               </l>
               <l>Here's the ſubſtance of Religion in one Chain,</l>
               <l>Thô brevity in every head was my aim:</l>
               <l>I had rather ſpeak five words with underſtanding,</l>
               <l>Than ten thouſand unknown words be banding.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.19.</note>

               <l>I have not ſtruck at Bark of the Tree,</l>
               <l>But at the Root and ſubſtance, you may ſee:</l>
               <l>Here is how to do Duty,
<note place="margin">Rev. 3.17.18. Luke 17.10.</note> and herein,</l>
               <l>To reſt in Duty done, a dangerous ſin:</l>
               <l>There are but two ways, mind them well,</l>
               <l>Sin, and duties reſted in, lead to Hell:</l>
               <l>Full of extreams are many in our days,</l>
               <l>To deſtroy Souls,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.11.</note> Satan hath many ways.</l>
               <l>Some do duty out of thoughts of Merit;</l>
               <l>Others do not their duty, ſuch a baſe ſpirit</l>
               <l>Of Extreams doth abound in our Land,</l>
               <l>Few do their duty as Chriſt doth Command.

               </l>
               <l>Some do duty, but love of merit affect;</l>
               <l>Others their duty, Chriſt's Command neglect.</l>
               <l>To do duty don't delay, but reſt on none</l>
               <l>For Salvation, but on Jeſus Chriſt alone:</l>
               <l>Don't reſt on outward performances done,</l>
               <l>Like moſt, but by Faith on Chriſt the Son.</l>

                  <l>I was in <hi>London,</hi> ſome Jeſuit, no doubt,</l>
                  <l>In vindication of Croſſes a Paper ſet out;</l>

                  <l>And not in the acting of their own will;</l>
                  <l>God's will and pleaſure is the only reaſon</l>

<note place="margin">Object.</note>

                  <l>Hath appointed ſome unto eternal Miſery;

                  <l>'Tis in vain for ſuch to hear and pray,</l>
                  <l>And to uſe the means of Salvation's way;</l>
                  <l>Were as good do nothing in their Station,</l>
                  <l>If they be Reprobated, ordain'd to Damnation.</l>
                  <l>There is no Man knows his Reprobation,

                  <l>'Tis God's ſecret, and to us 'tis very obſcure;</l>
                  <l>Let's follow the Scripture, a rule more ſure.</l>
                  <l>Secret things belong to God,
<note place="margin">Deut. 29.29.</note> let's not flatter</l>
                  <l>Our ſelves, let's do duty, and paſs this matter;</l>
                  <l>And know this, whatever any pretend,</l>
                  <l>God appoints the means, as well as the end.</l>
                  <l>For as God hath appointed Men to Glory;
<note place="margin">Eph. 1.4.</note>
                  </l>
                  <l>Conſider it well, don't think 'tis a ſtory:</l>
                  <l>So, God hath appointed them to Sanctification;</l>
                  <l>And to the uſe of all in their Generation:
<note place="margin">2 Theſ 2.13, 14.</note>
                  </l>
                  <l>Holy means to attain the end, Salvation,</l>
                  <l>And accordingly live in their Converſation.</l>
                  <l>And for ought I know, one reaſon may be,</l>
                  <l>Why God from Man conceals his Decree</l>
                  <l>Of Reprobation, for the Lord is independant;</l>
                  <l>Therefore, Man ſhould be ſtill Attendant</l>
                  <l>On the uſe of means,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 40.29, 30, 31.</note> as a Creature-dependant</l>
                  <l>On God; for though Man be weak in's ſtation;</l>
                  <l>Yet from God, Man hath a Power by derivation,</l>
                  <l>In and by uſe of the means, 'tis plain;
<note place="margin">Mal. 3.14.</note>
                  </l>
                  <l>Therefore, don't ſay, to uſe means 'tis in vain.</l>
                  <l>Faith comes by hearing, Scripture's record,
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.17.</note>
                  </l>
                  <l>There's a power in Man to hear the Word;</l>

                  <l>Till Chriſt came,
<note place="margin">verſe 8.</note> and made him free,</l>
                  <l>Had not power of himſelf ſo to be;</l>
                  <l>Yet wait on Ordinances, but reſt on none</l>
                  <l>For Salvation, but on Chriſt alone.</l>
                  <l>Some ſoon enjoy by faith this Treaſure,</l>
                  <l>Others God's pleas'd to hold with longer leiſure,</l>
                  <l>What ſhall I ſay to this, 'tis his pleaſure?</l>
                  <l>Let's do our duty in faith, not meaſure</l>
                  <l>God's Diſpenſations,
<note place="margin">Mat. 20, 3, 6.</note> he is God of power,</l>
                  <l>Calls ſome the third, ſome the eleventh hour;</l>
                  <l>Then don't conclude thy Reprobation bold,</l>
                  <l>Don't exclude thy ſelf out of Chriſt's fold.

                  <l>Is not thy duty, 'tis no work for thee;</l>
                  <l>Therefore to the means thy ſelf apply,</l>
                  <l>Depend on Chriſt in uſe of means, try,</l>
                  <l>He may have mercy,
<note place="margin">2 King 7.3, 4.</note> if not, can but die;</l>
                  <l>Take the Lepers reſolution, to Chriſt fly,</l>
                  <l>Mind what's ſaid before, as you paſs by,</l>
                  <l>For elected Sinners ſalvation Chriſt did die.</l>
                  <l>The work of Salvation is by God, ſee</l>
                  <l>By the inchoation, or beginning of the decree,</l>
                  <l>In Chriſt, as the means of God's diſpenſation,</l>
                  <l>And by the Spirit,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.2, 3, 4.</note> in way of conſummation;</l>
                  <l>The means is made effectual to Salvation:</l>
                  <l>The Spirit doth work faith, and doth apply</l>
                  <l>The means in all elect, tho' not immediately.</l>
                  <l>In all the Spirit works grace without diſpute;
<note place="margin">Eph. 3.7.</note>
                  </l>
                  <l>Then obedience, holineſs, is the firſt fruit</l>
                  <l>Of faith,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.22.</note> and way to Heaven, 'tis plain</l>
                  <l>In Scripture, then do thy duty, I ſay again.</l>
                  <l>God hath required thee the means to uſe,</l>
                  <l>As reveal'd in Scripture, don't it refuſe.</l>
                  <l>Remember what I ſay,
<note place="margin">Joh. 14.26.</note> don't it forget,</l>
                  <l>At Chriſt's Command,
<note place="margin">Luk. 5.4. to the 7 verſe.</note> let down the net;</l>
                  <l>Perhaps the Lord hath appointed thee</l>
                  <l>To life and glory in his eternal Decree,</l>
                  <l>Which is obſcure, and hidden from we.</l>

                  <l>To make thy Election ſure,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.10.</note> is more plain</l>
                  <l>In Scripture, then do thy duty once again,</l>
                  <l>Tho' thou know'ſt not the iſſue or event,</l>
                  <l>Leave that to God, and the means frequent:</l>
                  <l>Uſe Ordinances, and practiſe them in Power,</l>
                  <l>God may ſave thee in the trying hour;</l>
                  <l>Yet in uſing them, don't ſuch thoughts cheriſh,

                  <l>Having this Seal, God knows who are his.</l>
                  <l>Don't venture thy immortal Soul amiſs,

                  <l>Who knows, God may receive thee into bliſs</l>
